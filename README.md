## üî• Overview

**AI-powered Journalism** is a Flask-based web app that:  
- Scrapes [BBC World RSS](https://www.bbc.com/news/world/rss.xml).  
- Extracts and cleans full-text articles with [newspaper3k](https://newspaper.readthedocs.io/).  
- Summarizes them into concise bullet points with [LLaMA 3](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama).  
- Lets you chat with articles directly via natural language questions.

# AI-powered Journalism

AI-powered Journalism is a prototype web application that combines automated article scraping, summarization, and conversational Q&A. It fetches articles from an [RSS feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS), parses them into structured text, and enables interaction through summarization and question answering powered by LLaMA 3. The application is built with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) and uses HTML templates for rendering content.

---

## Techniques

* **RSS Feed Parsing**: Uses [feedparser](https://pythonhosted.org/feedparser/) to process RSS XML and extract article metadata.
* **Article Extraction**: Leverages [newspaper3k](https://newspaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for structured downloading and parsing of article text.
* **Templating**: Applies [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) to render server-side templates dynamically with variables passed from Flask routes.
* **Form Handling with Query Parameters**: Uses `<form>` with [hidden inputs](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/hidden) and query strings to maintain state across requests without sessions.
* **Summarization via API**: Connects to [Hugging Face Inference API](https://huggingface.co/inference-api) through the [OpenAI Python client](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) for structured, bullet-point summaries.
* **Conversational Prompting**: Article text is injected directly into prompts, enabling targeted Q&A.
* **CSS UI Styling**: The frontend includes [box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow), [border-radius](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius), and hover effects for card layouts.

## Project Structure

```bash
AI-powered-journalism/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py              # Flask application logic: scraping, summarization, chat
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/          # Jinja2 HTML templates
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ news.html       # Displays articles list with links to chat
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ chat.html       # Summarization + conversational UI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static/             # Placeholder for CSS, JS, and images
```

* **`templates/`**: Holds server-rendered HTML files.
* **`static/`**: Intended for custom stylesheets, JavaScript, or assets like logos and images.

## Notes

* Prototype release. Focused on scraping, summarization, and conversational Q&A workflows.
* Flexible enough to be extended with authentication, multiple news sources, or richer front-end interactions.
